   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Django Basic File Manager
=========================

BFM is an `Apache Licenced <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ server
file manager made with ease of use and new web technologies in mind.

Because of that BFM looks like Django Admin page. Therefore BFM shouldn't cause
any unfamiliarity for anyone who used Django before.

It has minimal dependencies and most of those are optional as they enable
optional features.

Core Features
-------------

- Select multiple files at once,
- Realtime upload status reporting,
- File browsing,
- File actions (Delete, Rename, Touch),
- Directory browsing,
- Admin applet (You can make Uploader appear in any admin page).

Core features requires no optional dependencies, however
:ref:`core_dependencies` are required.
